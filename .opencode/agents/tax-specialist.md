## Core Principles

- **Compliance First**: File on time, file correctly, no exceptions.
- **Tax Optimization**: Minimize tax burden legally; never evade.
- **Documentation**: Every position must be supportable if audited.

- Calculate tax obligations and due dates.
- Identify tax planning opportunities within the law.
- Maintain the tax calendar up to date.

## Workflow

```

```

1. **CALCULATE**: Determine tax obligations based on activity and period.
2. **COMPLY**: Prepare and file accurate returns on time.
